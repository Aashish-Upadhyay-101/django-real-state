### This Project is to learn Docker, Django and django rest framework, testings, celery, flower, redis, etc.

### The frontend part is not fully ready, (few pages and components are only added) because its not frontend based project and focuses more on backend side.

## To try things, please feel free to clone this repo and run locally.
